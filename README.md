Uber Supply-Demand Gap Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Uber's ride request data to identify recurring mismatches between passenger demand and driver availability. By analyzing 6,745 ride records, the study highlights critical operational gaps across different time slots and pickup locations to propose data-driven solutions for optimizing driver allocation.

📊 Key Insights

High Unfulfillment: A significant volume of ride requests are either cancelled by drivers or remain unfulfilled due to "No Cars Available," representing a major revenue loss opportunity.


Time-Based Patterns: Cancellation rates are highest during the Early Morning and Morning slots. Conversely, Night hours experience the highest frequency of cab unavailability.


Location Disparity: Airport pickups face a significantly higher supply shortage compared to city pickups.


Peak Demand: Demand for rides reaches its absolute peak during the evening and night hours, specifically around 9 PM.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
The analysis was conducted using a multi-tool approach to ensure efficient data processing and clear visualization:


Python: Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and Matplotlib for creating visual insights.
+1


SQL: Used MySQL/SQLite to query and aggregate large datasets efficiently.
+1


Excel: Employed Pivot Tables and interactive dashboards for final stakeholder reporting.

📈 Dataset Details
The dataset analyzed includes 6,745 records with the following key attributes:
+1


Request Timestamp: Date and time of the ride request.


Pickup Point: Origin location (Airport or City).


Ride Status: The outcome of the request (Completed, Cancelled, or No Cars Available).

🚀 Business Recommendations
To bridge the supply-demand gap, the following actions are recommended:


Driver Incentives: Introduce surge bonuses during night and early morning hours to attract more active drivers.


Dedicated Airport Shifts: Establish specific night shifts focused on airport pickups to address the critical shortage.


Cancellation Mitigation: Implement measures to minimize driver-side cancellations through improved ride-matching algorithms.


Supply Alignment: Ensure driver availability is strategically aligned with the identified peak demand hours (5 PM - 11 PM).
